After the base row come smaller copies, each half as wide as the one before, whose texels keep the nearest occluder of the two texels they cover.
// The shadow is the share of a window centered on the point that lies behind its occluders, where every texel counts by how much of it the window covers, so the edge moves smoothly with the point instead of in steps of whole texels. The window is as wide as the filter and never narrower than the texels one pixel spans, and the smallest copy that still gives it at most 16 texels carries it, so a wide soft edge costs as little as a sharp one.
